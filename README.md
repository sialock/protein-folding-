Hi everyone :)
This code performs the following steps:


1_Downloads and loads a protein structure from the PDB.
2_Analyzes the structure using MDTraj.
3_Executes a simple Monte Carlo simulation to fold the protein.
4_Saves the folded structure to a PDB file.
You can run this code and see the results of the protein folding simulation. Note that this simulation is simplified, and more accurate simulations require more complex energy functions and advanced algorithms.
